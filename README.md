## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Netflix data from 2017 to better understand:

1. If there is a Trend towards TV Shows.
2. Which countries produce more TV Shows than Movies.
3. If different production countries focus on the same genres.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
The raw data are stored in the .csv-format in the directory 'data' ('netflix_titles.csv').
There is only one Jupyter Notebook file called netflix_exploration.ipynb in the root directory. All analysis can be found in this file.
## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@jonas_fe/3-insights-about-netflixs-production-behaviour-5747430edf4d).
